# Sign-Language-Recognizer
Sign Languages are a set of languages that use predefined actions and movements to convey a message. These languages are primarily developed to aid deaf and other verbally challenged people. They use a simultaneous and precise combination of movement of hands, orientation of hands, hand shapes etc.


In this project, we aim towards analyzing and recognizing various words from a database of sign images. Database consists of various images with each image clicked in different light condition with different hand orientation. With such a divergent data set, we are able to train our system to good levels and thus obtain good results.
